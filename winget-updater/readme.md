## What this do?
Checks the listed packages if they are installed or not, also checks the version. if version is blacklisted it will try to get previous version. if nothing found, it will use fallback version.

## How to run on startup
simply create a shortcut of the update-winget-packages and put it into your startup folder. (WIN + R -> shell:startup)
